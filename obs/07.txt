అబ్బాయిలు పెద్దవాళ్ళయ్యారు.ఏశావు వేటగాడయ్యాడు.అయితే యాకోబు నెమ్మది పరుడు.అతను తన గుడారములోనే ఉండేవాడు.ఇస్సాకు ఏశావును చాలా ప్రేమించాడు.కాని రిబకాకు యాకోబు మీద ప్రేమ.​

ఒకసారి ఏశావు వేటనుండి తిరిగి వచ్చాడు.అతను అలసిపోయి,ఆకలితో బలహీనంగా ఉన్నాడు.యాకోబు వంట పాత్రలో చిక్కుడు కాయలు వండు తున్నాడు.ఏశావు ,"నేను ఆకలితో నీరసం అయిపోయాను,ఆ ఎర్రటి చిక్కుడు కాయలు నాకు కొంచెం పెట్టు" అని యాకోబును అడిగాడు.అయితే యాకోబు, "నీ జ్యేష్టత్వపుజన్మ హక్కుల్ని ఈ వేళ నాకు అమ్మివేయాలి" అన్నాడు.తన తండ్రి  ఐస్వర్యములో తన వాటాను ఏశావు యాకోబుకు అమ్మివేసాడు.అప్పుడు యాకోబు రొట్టె,భోజనం ఏశావుకు ఇచ్చాడు.

Isaac could not see well. Jacob came to Isaac and said, “I am Esau, I have come to receive your blessing.” When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes, he thought it was Esau and blessed him.

After twenty years away from his home in Canaan, Jacob returned there with his family, his servants, and all his herds of animals.{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-07-09.jpg?direct&}}

He was very afraid because he thought Esau still wanted to kill him. So he sent Esau many herds of animals as a gift. The servants who brought the animals said to Esau, “These animals are a gift from your servant, Jacob. He is coming soon.”

But Esau had already forgiven Jacob, and they were happily reunited. Jacob then lived peacefully in Canaan. Then Isaac died, and Jacob and Esau buried him. The covenant promises God had promised to Abraham and then to Isaac now passed on to Jacob.
