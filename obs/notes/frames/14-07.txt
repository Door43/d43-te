But the people did not listen to **Caleb** and **Joshua**. They became angry with **Moses** and **Aaron** and said, “**Why did you bring us to this horrible place**? We should have stayed in **Egypt rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves**.” The people wanted to choose a different leader to take them back to Egypt.
