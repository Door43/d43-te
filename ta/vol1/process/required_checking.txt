==== Purpose of Checking Levels ====

The purpose the [[te:ta:vol1:checking:toc_checkvol1_2|checking levels]] is primarily to help ensure that the translation has been made in accordance with the [[te:ta:vol1:intro:statement_of_faith|Statement of Faith]] and the [[te:ta:vol1:intro:translation_guidelines|Translation Guidelines]]. Another purpose for the checking levels is to increase the input and ownership of the translation among the community that will be using it. 

=== Checking Level 1 ===

[[te:ta:vol1:checking:level1|Checking Level 1]] is done primarily by the translation team, with some input from the language community. 

Please follow the [[te:ta:vol1:checking:level1|Steps for checking under Level One]] to complete a Level 1 check. 

After completing the Level 1 Check, you are encouraged to [[te:ta:vol1:process:intro_publishing|publish]] your translation and continue on to Checking Level 2 (see below). 

=== Checking Level 2 ===

[[te:ta:vol1:checking:level2|Checking Level 2]] is done to verify that representative groups from the local language community agree that the translation is a good one. It is done with a [[te:ta:vol1:checking:language_community_check|language community check]] and a [[te:ta:vol1:checking:church_leader_check|church leader check]]. 

After completing the Level 2 Check, you are encouraged to [[te:ta:vol1:process:intro_publishing|publish]] your translation and continue on to Checking Level 3 (see below), if you so desire. 

=== Checking Level 3 === 

[[te:ta:vol1:checking:level3|Checking Level 3]] has two possible tracks: track one requires church networks to approve the translation and track two requires one church network and one trained translation consultant. Be sure you work through the [[te:ta:vol1:checking:level3_questions|Level 3 Checking Questions]] while you complete this checking level. 

After completing the Level 3 Check, you are encouraged to [[te:ta:vol1:process:intro_publishing|publish]] your translation. This is the highest checking level.
