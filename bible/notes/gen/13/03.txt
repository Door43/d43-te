===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He continued on his journey**  - "He traveled by stages" or "he continued traveling from place to place." Since Abram took his household along, this can also be translated as "They continued on their journey."
  * **to the place where his tent had been before**  - The time can be made explicit: "to the place where he had set up his tent before he went to Egypt" (See [[te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit|Explicit and Implicit Information]]). Or translators may add a footnote that says "See Genesis 12:8."
  *   * **called on the name of Yahweh** - "prayed in the name of Yahweh” or “worshiped Yahweh." See how you translated this in [[te:bible:notes:gen:12:08|12:8]].
