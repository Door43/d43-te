\v 15 But then some other young man becomes king, and everyone starts to support him.
\v 16 Large crowds of people crowd around him. But after a few years, they will be tired of him, too. So it is all senseless, like trying to control the wind.

<usfm>
\v 15 However, I saw everyone who was alive and walking around  under the sun submitting themselves to another young man who rose up as king.
\v 16 There is no end to all the people who want to obey the new king, but later many of them will no longer praise him. Surely this situation is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.
