\v 20 If a man has sex with a slave woman who has been promised that she will marry some other man, but she has not been bought by that man and is still a slave, the man who had sex with her must be punished. But because she is still a slave, she and the man who had sex with her must not be killed.
\v 21 However, that man must bring a ram to \add be slaughtered at\add* the entrance of the Sacred Tent area, to be an offering in order that he no longer be guilty for his sin.
\v 22 The priest will offer that ram to me in order that the man will be forgiven for the sin that he committed, and I will forgive him.

\v 20 If a man sleeps with a slave woman who has been promised to marry some other man, but if she has not been bought by that man and is still a slave, these two people must be punished. But because she was still a slave, she and the man who slept with her must not be executed.
\v 21 However, that man must bring a ram to be slaughtered at the entrance of the sacred tent area, to be an offering in order that he no longer be guilty for his sin.
\v 22 The priest will offer that ram to me. Then I will forgive that man for the sin which he committed.
