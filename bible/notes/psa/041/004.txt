===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Yahweh, have mercy on me: heal my soul**  - AT: "Yahweh, act mercifully toward me and heal me" (UDB)
    * **speak evil against me**  - The psalmist goes on to show what evils are part of their talk.  (See:[[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **he says worthless things**  - AT: "they pretend to be concerned about me" (UDB) Note that the ULB uses a singular pronoun meaning one enemy.  The UDB uses a plural pronoun referring to any of his enemies.  
    * **his heart gathers up my disaster for itself**  - AT: "they eagerly listen to all the bad news about myself" (UDB) (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_singularpronouns]])
