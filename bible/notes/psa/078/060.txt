===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.

  * **He abandoned**  - The pronouns "he" and "his" in these verses refer to God.
  * **allowed the ark of his strength to be captured and gave his glory into the enemy's hand**  - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: Doublet)
  * **gave his glory**  - The ark of the covenant was associated with God's presence, and so his glory. (See: Metonymy)
  * **into the enemy's hand**  - This means giving over to the power or control of the enemy. (See: Metonymy)
