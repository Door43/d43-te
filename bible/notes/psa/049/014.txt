<usfm>
\q
\v 14 They are appointed, like a flock, to go to sheol;
\q death will be their shepherd;
\q the upright will have power over them in the morning;
\q their beauty will be for sheol to consume
\q so that there be no habitation for it.
\q
\v 15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of sheol;
\q he will receive me. 
\qs Selah\qs*

===== Translation Notes: =====
The author continues to describe people who believe their wealth will save them.

  * **like a flock**- People are compared to a flock of sheep because they will follow their shepherd. (See [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **death will be their shepherd** - This phrase refers to death and the person who leads sheep.  This means the choices of the people will only result in their deaths. AT: "death will take them away as a shepherd leads away sheep to be slaughtered" (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) 
  * **in the morning**  - Night is associated with death so the morning refers to after they die. AT: "after they die" (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **their beauty will be for sheol ... there be no habitation for it.** - "their beauty will be consumed in sheol, far away from their homes" or "their bodies will be comsumed in sheol and sheol will become their home"
  * **beauty** - "form" or "image"
  * **from the power of sheol** - AT: "and sheol will not have power over me"
