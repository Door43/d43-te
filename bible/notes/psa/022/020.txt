===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **my soul** - AT: "me" (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **the sword** - The sword is a common way of refering to a violent enemy. AT: "my enemies" (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
  * **my precious life** - "the only thing I have left"
  * **paws of the dogs ... lion's mouth ... horns of the wild ox** - Each of these is a double figure of speech. First, the paws, mouth, and horns stand for the animal as a whole in a synecdoche. Second, all three animals refer to David's enemies as a metaphor. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the horns of the wild ox** - AT: "the strength of the wild ox" or "the wild ox" (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
  * **wild ox** - The word "wild" here means that has not been captured and tamed by humans.
