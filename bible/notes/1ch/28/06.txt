===== Translation Notes: =====

David continues speaking to the Israelites.  In these two verses, David tells the people what Yahweh told him about Solomon.

  * **my house**  - the temple of Yahweh (God)
  * **as you are this day**  - God is speaking to David; therefore, "**you**" refers to David.
