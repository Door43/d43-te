\v 21 When you make a vow to Yahweh your God, you must not be slow in fulfilling it, for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you;  it would be sin in you not to fulfill it.
\v 22 But if you will refrain from making a vow, it will be no sin in you.
\v 23 That which has gone out from your lips you must observe and do; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God, anything that you have freely promised with your mouth.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * ** If you will refrain from making a vow, it will be no sin in you ** - No one from the children of Israel was under any obligation to vow anything; it was a purely voluntary act.
  * **you must observe and do **- AT: "you must keep and perform, even a freewill offering"
  * **gone out from your lipsâ€¦freely promised with your mouth**  - This emphasizes the personal responsibility of fulfilling a promise after its production. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]], [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) AT: "Whatever you promise you must observe and do; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God, anything that you have voluntarily given your word."
