\v 12 You must have a place also outside the camp to which you will go;
\v 13 and you will have something among your tools to dig with; when you squat down to relieve yourself, you must dig with it and then put back the earth and cover up what has come out from you.
\v 14 For Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp to give you victory and to hand over your enemies to you. Therefore your camp must be holy, so that he may not see any unclean thing among you and turn away from you.
