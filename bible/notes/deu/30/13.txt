===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **in your mouth and in your heart **- These words mean basically the same thing. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **‘Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us and make us to hear it, so that we may do it?’**  - This hypothetical question makes the speaker say that God's commandments are hidden far away, across the sea. AT: “God's commands are so difficult that in order to obey them, someone would need to travel across the sea and return and tell us what they are.” (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **But the word is very near to you**  - AT: "But God's commandments are within easy reach of every person and are thus understandable." (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
