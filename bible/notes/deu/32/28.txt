===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 20-29, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **For Israel is a nation devoid of wisdom**  - This means â€œThe people of Israel are without wisdom" 
  * **no understanding in them - **"The people of Israel have no understanding"
  * **Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their coming fate! **  - Moses makes an exclamation to an imaginary person, as a way to show how he wished the statement were true. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
  * **consider their coming fate**  - AT: "discern what their end will be" This means that if they had wisdom, they would understand why they were being punished by Yahweh, for not obeying him and serving only him.
