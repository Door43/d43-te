===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

  * **They - ** This refers to the people of Israel.
  * **gods that recently appeared **- AT: "new gods that had come recently"
  * **You have deserted the Rock **- Moses is saying that Yahweh is as strong and solid as a rock (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **who became your father, God who gave you birth**  - AT: "who fathered you, God who gave you life" This metaphor compares Yahweh as a father and as a mother, caring for the people of Israel. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
