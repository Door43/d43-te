===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **They have acted corruptly**  - "They" refers to the Israelites because of their frequent disobedience and idolatry. AT: "They have corrupted themselves"
  * **a perverted and crooked generation**  - This is saying the same thing in different ways to emphasize how wicked the generation is. This could be translated as “wicked people who do not honor God.” (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Do you reward Yahweh in this way - ** Moses uses a rhetorical question to bring their attention to the way they have acted in the past, contrary to what Yahweh asked them to do. They had not shown to be grateful for all that Yahweh had done for them. AT: "Do you repay Yahweh in this way" (See:[[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **foolish and senseless**  - This is saying the same thing in different ways to emphasize the idea. This could be translated as “unwise” (See:[[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **Is he not your father, the one who has created you? He made you and established you. **- Moses uses a rhetorical question to remind the people of Israel that without Yahweh they would not even exist as persons or as a nation. (See:[[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
