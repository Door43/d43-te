===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 37-42, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **I will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword will devour flesh - ** (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) This is a metaphor comparing the arrows and the sword with a person's mouth that can drink and eat. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) The edge of the sword is called its mouth, because as a mouth, it devours. AT: "My arrows will drip with blood and my sword will pierce flesh"
  * **with the blood of the killed and the captives, and from the heads of the leaders of the enemy. **  - This refers to the people that would be judged by Yahweh.
