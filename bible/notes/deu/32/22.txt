===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 20-29, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **a fire is kindled by my anger**  - Moses is comparing the anger of Yahweh to the start of a fire. "Kindled" is a metaphor for the beginning of Yahweh's anger, like a fire is kindled. AT: "a fire breaks out in my anger" (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **is burning to the lowest sheol**  - AT: "is burning down to the realm of the dead below" This metaphor compares Yahweh's anger with a fire that does not stop burning; it burns down to the lowest depths. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
