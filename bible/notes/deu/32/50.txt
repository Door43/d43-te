\v 51 You will die because both of you disobeyed me in the presence of the Israelite people, when you all were at the springs of Meribah near Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. You did not honor and respect me in the presence of the Israelite people in the way that I deserve because I am God.

<usfm>
\v 50 You will die on the mountain that you go up and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your fellow Israelite died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.
\v 51 This will happen because you were unfaithful to me among the people of Israel at the waters of Meribah in Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you did not treat me with honor and respect among the people of Israel.
\v 52 For you will see the land before you, but you will not go there, into the land that I am giving to the people of Israel.‚Äù

  * **be gathered to your people**  - AT: "join your ancestors" This means that Moses would be associated in death and joined to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It does not mean he would be buried with his ancestors, as his ancestors had not been buried in Mount Abarim.
