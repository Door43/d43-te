===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 20-29, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy - **  AT: "But I feared the provocation of the enemy " (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
  * **judge mistakenly**  - "misunderstand"
  * **and that they would say - **  and that the enemy would say
  * **Our hand is exalted**  - The enemy's "hand" means their strength or power. "Our strength has triumphed" or "Our power has won" (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
