===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 37-42, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **Where are their gods**  - This question is used to emphasize to the people of Israel how worthless it is to worship false gods. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **the rock in whom they took refuge - **  This "rock" means the idols and false gods they worshiped. The real “Rock” refers to Yahweh who is strong and solid. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **The gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings?**  - The false gods are compared to human beings that can eat and drink. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) This is a reference to the way the people of Israel were supposed to sacrifice to Yahweh, offering the fat of the sacrifices to Yahweh, and the drink offering of wine which was a sweet savour to Yahweh. By worshipping the false gods and sacrificing to false gods, the people of Israel were offering sacred things to false gods.
  * **Let them rise up and help you **- "Let the false gods do something to help you"
