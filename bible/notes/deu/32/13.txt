===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses continues to compare the people of Israel to a man. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) He starts to describe the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

  * **He made him ride on the heightes of the land - **  AT: "He made him ride on the high places of the land" This means that Yahweh helped the people of Israel to take possession of the land.
  * **he fed them the fruits of the field - **  AT: "The people of Israel ate the produce of the field" This means that Yahweh brought them to a land with lots of produce they could eat.
  * **He nourished him with honey from the rock and oil from the flinty crag - **  The land they were about to posses, Canaan, had many wild bees, with hives inside rock holes. And also olive trees, which grow on rocks, hills and mountains, as in the mount of Olives. AT: "He provided honey for him from the rock and oil from the stony ground"
