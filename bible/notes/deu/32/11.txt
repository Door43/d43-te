===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **As an eagle that guards her nest and flutters over her young, Yahweh spread out his wings and took them, and carried them on his pinions - ** AT: "In the same way that an eagle guards her nest and hovers over its young, Yahweh opened wide his wings, catching them, and carried them on the outer end of his wings." ( See:[[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) In this metaphor, Yahweh's care for the people of Israel is compared to the care that an eagle has for its babies. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Yahweh alone led him; no foreign god was with him - ** Moses continues to compare the people of Israel to a man alone in a desert, a place without hope, food or water. This means that Yahweh led the people of Israel throughout their years in the desert, after they had left Egypt. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
