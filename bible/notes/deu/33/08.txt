===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Your Thummim and your Urim**  - The Thummim and Urim were sacred stones carried on the breastplate of the high priest and used at times to determine God's direction.
    * **whom you tested at Massah**  - Massah means "testing" in Hebrew. This is a play on words. (See [[te:bible:notes:deu:|6:16]].}
    * **with whom you struggled at the waters of Meribah**  - Meribah means "argue" or "quarrel" in Hebrew. This is another play on words.
    * **the one you are pleased with**  - "your holy one" This probably refers to Moses as a representative of the tribe of Levi.
