===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **do what is in your heart, for Yahweh is with you**  - The sense here is that Nathan believed that it is Yahweh that had put this desire in David's heart. Also, the "your" and "you" here refers only to David. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of You]])
  * **Will you build me a house in which to live?**  - This is a [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]. God is almighty and obviously does not need a house to live in. Also, the "you" here refers only to David. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of You]])
