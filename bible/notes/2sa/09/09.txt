  * [[:te:obe:kt:lord]]
  * [[:te:obe:other:servant]]
 

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **you**  and **your**  - All of the occurrences of these words refer only to Ziba since David is addressing him directly. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of You]]). Mephibosheth is the third person here and is being referred to but not being directly addressed.
  * **will always eat at my table**  - implying eating together with David.
