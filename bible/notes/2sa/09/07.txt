===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **for I will surely show you**  - Here the "you" refers only to Mephibosheth since David is addressing him. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of You]])
  * **you will always eat at my table**  - Here the "my table" refers to being together with or in David's presence. (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy|Metonymy]]) Here the "you" refers only to Mephibosheth since David is addressing him. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of You]])
  * **What is your servant, that you should...?**  - This is a [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion|Rhetorical Question]]. Also, in this verse the "your" and "you,"both refer only to David since Mephibosheth is addressing him back. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you|Forms of You]])
  * **on such a dead dog**  - or "on such a has-been". The implication is that Saul's kingdom is history in the same way that a dead dog is history and that it is impossible to bring back the kingdom to Saul. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
