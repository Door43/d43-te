\v 8 Then Jonathan said, "We will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them.
\v 9 If they say to us, 'Wait there until we come over to you'â€”then we will stay in our place and will not cross over to them.
\v 10 But if they reply, 'Come over to us,' then we will cross over; because Yahweh has given them into our hand. This will be the sign to us."

  * **cross over to the men** - The Philistines are on the other side of the valley from Jonathan and his armor bearer. This means "travel from here to the men." 
  * **given them into our hand** - The word "hand" here represents control. AT: "given them into our control." (See: [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
