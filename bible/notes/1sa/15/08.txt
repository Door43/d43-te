===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **he completely destroyed all the people **  - or "he completely killed all the people"
    * **But Saul and the people spared Agag**  - or "But Saul and the people did not kill Agag" or "But Saul and the people allowed Agag to live"
    * **Everything that was good, they did not destroy**  - Prefer "destroy" over "kill" here because things may or may not include more than just living things.
