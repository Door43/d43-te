===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **I was afraid of the people and obeyed their voice**  - Saul was King and would not have been afraid of the people in a physical sense.  Here "the people" is a [[:te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] for the people's words and what they thought of Saul.   See the UDB for an alternate clarification.
