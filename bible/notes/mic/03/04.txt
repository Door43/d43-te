===== Translation Notes: =====

Micah continues speaking.

  * **cry out to Yahweh**  - "shout to Yahweh for help"
  * **He will hide his face from you**  - This means God will not hear their cries. They would not hear the cries of the poor, and so they receive the same treatment from God. (See: [[:te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
