\q1 those who make idols are always disappointed
\q2 because their idols do nothing for them.
\q1 The images that they make are not real gods;
\q2 they are lifeless.
\q1
\v 15 Idols are worthless; they are just objects that make a mockery of the true God;
\q2 there will be a time when they all will be destroyed.
\q1
\v 16 But the God whom we Israelites worship is not like those idols;
\q2 he is the one who created everything that exists;

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 Every man has become ignorant, without knowledge. Every metalworker is put to shame by his idols.
\q For his cast poured images are frauds; there is no life in them.
\q
\v 15 They are useless, the work of mockers; they will perish at the time of their punishment.
\q
\v 16 But God, the portion of Jacob, is not like these, for he is the molder of all things.
\q Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; Yahweh of hosts is his name.
