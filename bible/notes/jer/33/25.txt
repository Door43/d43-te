\v 25 But this is what I say: 'I will not reject my people any quicker than I will change my laws that control the day and the night, the sky and the earth.
\v 26 Similarly, I will never abandon the descendants of David or the other descendants of Jacob, and I will always allow descendants of David to rule the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will bring them back to their land, and I will act mercifully toward them.'~"
