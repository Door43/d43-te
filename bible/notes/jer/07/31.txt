\v 31 They have built altars at Topheth in Hinnom Valley \add outside Jerusalem\add*,

\q2 I never even thought that anyone would do that.
\q1
\v 32 So they should beware!
\q2 There will be a time when that place will no longer be called Topheth or the Hinnom Valley;
\q2 instead, it will be called the Valley of Slaughter.

\v 31 Then they built the shrine of Topheth that is in the valley of Ben Hinnom. They did this to burn their sons and daughters in fire—something that I did not command. It never came up in my mind.
\v 32 So see, days are coming'—this is Yahweh’s declaration—'when it will no longer be called Topheth or Valley of Ben Hinnom. It will be the Valley of Slaughter; they will bury bodies in Topheth until there is no room left.
