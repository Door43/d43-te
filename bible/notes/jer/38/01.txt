\v 1 Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard the words that Jeremiah was declaring to all the people. He was saying,
\v 2 “Yahweh says this: Anyone staying in this city will be killed by sword, famine, and plague. But anyone who goes out to the Chaldeans will survive. He will have his own life as his plunder, for he will live.
\v 3 Yahweh says this: This city will be given over into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.”
