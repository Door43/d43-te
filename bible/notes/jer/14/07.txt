\q2
\v 7 Even though our iniquities testify against us, Yahweh, act for the sake of your name.
\q2 For our faithless actions increase; we have sinned against you.
\q2
\v 8 Hope of Israel, the one who saves him in the time of distress,
\q2 why will you be like a stranger in the land, like a foreign wanderer who stretches out and spends just one night?
\q2

\q2 For you are in our midst, Yahweh! Your name has been proclaimed over us. Do not leave us.
