===== Translation Notes: =====

The Levites continue their prayer before all the people.

  * **brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees** - The implied information is that God brought Abram to the Promised Land, later named Israel. (See: [[te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
  * **gave him the name Abraham** - As part of his covenant with Abram, God gave him a new identity. Here the meaning of the names Abram and Abraham is important. AT: "changed his name to Abraham." (See: [[te:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
  * **You found his heart was faithful** - Here "his heart" (part of a person) represents Abraham as a person. AT: "You saw that he was faithful." (See: [[te:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]] and [[te:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **before you** - "in your sight" or "in your presence"
  * **the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites** - These are people groups who are descended from the same ancestor and share a common language and culture. (See: [[te:obe:other:peoplegroup]])
  * **You have kept your promise** - "Your words are righteous"
