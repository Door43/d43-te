====== beast ======

===== Facts: =====

The term "beast" defines both living and metaphorical creatures.

  * The bible refers to both domestic and wild animals as beasts.
  * A domestic beast was usually a reference to a donkey or "ass."
  * The metaphorical beasts in Revelation and Daniel represent two different but related concepts: the first, all political rule opposed to God; the second, all pagan cults that support those governments.
